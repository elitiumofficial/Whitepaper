Elitium provides a luxury lifestyle platform for its clientele
using a sustainable cryptocurrency solution.<br>
Elitium is much more than a cryptocurrency or blockchain company. We are building the future of luxury.

It is a grand vision, but it stems from modest beginnings: a crypto-payments solution developed at digital yacht charter platform Boatsters — the innovation that let clients rent a superyacht using any one of 55 cryptocurrencies.

It was a development that played a major role in Boatsters success. Such was its impact that our team started researching the advantages of the blockchain and how it could overhaul the luxury experience on the whole — say, through efficiencies in integrating smart contracts and digital payment solutions.
